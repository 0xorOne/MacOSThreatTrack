# MacOS-ThreatTrack

> The tool is being tested in the beta phase, and it only gathers MacOS system information at this time.

## Description

Bash tool used for proactive detection of malicious activity on macOS systems.

I was inspired by [Venator-Swift](https://github.com/richiercyrus/Venator-Swift) and decided to create a bash version of the tool.

## Gathered information

```
[+] System info
[+] Users list
[+] Environment variables
[+] Process list

```

## Todo

1) Saving output as JSON instead of printing out the result.

## Note

The tool was created before December 20,2022.
